InvoiceMe App

ToDos:
- create scheduled firebase functions that will generate automatically a pdf invoice for the current month and send it to the client by email
- add paypal/stripe integration for payout invoices
- Let client users create a scheduled email that sends an invoice template to a client on nth day of the month.
- Let business users create a scheduled email that sends payment for an received invoice to client (using stripe or paypal)
| - the above requires a notification to the business user saying they received anew invoice, review upcoming automated payment details, in case they want to change payment method, change amount, etc.
