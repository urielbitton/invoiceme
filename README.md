Others
- Edit scheduled invoices

- create email subcollection for users, all emails they send on the app should be saved there.
- add AppModal for users to see status of their sent invoices (try to get a read receipt from sendgrid, show other details about invoice)

- Let business users create a scheduled email that sends payment for an received invoice to client (using stripe or paypal)
